Simple php mail sending script for contact forms.

Features

  * Open source: see sendmail on Google code
  * Respond to POST forms
  * 2-file installation: edit the configuration file and upload both files to your server.
  * Allow dynamic message creation from a detailed form (see using lbl1 and msg1)
  * Some protection against bots - you must add a preset key-value pair to your form, otherwise sendmail will fail
  * Can redirect, show alert, show short message or respond to an ajax request
  * Save messages to a log file (using preset templates)
